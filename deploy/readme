Once the pluto container is available in your docker repository, run startpluto.sh to start the pluto database and the "pluto" container using the sample_config configuration

To import the sample rulesets into the database:

1. install node if it is not already installed

2. cd to the rulests folder:
  $ cd {PLUTO}/sample_config/rulesets

3. if this is the first time running the importer, install some dependencies:
  $ ./importer_setup.sh

4. import the rulesets:
  $ ./run_importer.sh


To extend the pluto container to include dependencies for plugins, see the Dockerfile to extend the pluto container and run that extended container the same way that it's started in startpluto.sh
