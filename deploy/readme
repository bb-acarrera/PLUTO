First, pull pluto and pluto_dbloader into your local repo.

Once the pluto container is available in your docker repository, run initpluto.sh to run the pluto database and the "pluto" container using the sample_config configuration

To extend the pluto container to include dependencies for plugins, see the Dockerfile to extend the pluto container and run that extended container the same way that it's started in startpluto.sh
